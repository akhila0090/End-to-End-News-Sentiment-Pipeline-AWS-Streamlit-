# End-to-End-News-Sentiment-Pipeline-AWS-Streamlit-
This project implements a fully automated, end-to-end news sentiment analysis pipeline using AWS cloud services and a Streamlit web application. It fetches real-time news headlines, analyzes sentiment using VADER (NLTK), stores results in Amazon S3 and PostgreSQL (RDS), and visualizes the insights in a responsive dashboard hosted via Docker and deployed on Amazon ECS Fargate.
